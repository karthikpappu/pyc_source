"""================
Axon postoffices
================

A postoffice object looks after linkages. It can create and destroy them and
keeps records of what ones currently exist. It hands out linkage objects that
can be used as handles to later unlink (remove) the linkage.

THIS IS AN AXON INTERNAL! If you are writing components you do not need to
understand this.

Developers wishing to understand how Axon is implemented should read on with
interest!

How is this used in Axon?
-------------------------

Every component has its own postoffice. The component's link() and unlink()
methods instruct the post office to create and remove linkages.

When a component terminates, it asks its post office to remove any outstanding
linkages.

Example usage
-------------

Creating a link from an inbox to an outbox; a passthrough link from an inbox
to another inbox; and a passthrough link from an outbox to another outbox::
    
    po = postoffice()
    c0 = component()
    c1 = component()
    c2 = component()
    c3 = component()

    link1 = po.link((c1,"outbox"), (c2,"inbox"))
    link2 = po.link((c2,"inbox"), (c3,"inbox"), passthrough=1)
    link3 = po.link((c0,"outbox"), (c1,"outbox"), passthrough=2)

Removing one of the linkages; then all linkages involving component c3; then all
the rest::
    
    po.unlink(thelinkage=link3)
    
    po.unlink(thecomponent=c3)
    
    po.unlinkAll()

More detail
-----------

A postoffice object keeps creates and destroys objects and keeps a record of
which ones currently exist.

The linkage object returned when a linkage is created serves only as a handle.
It does not form any operation part of the linkage.

Multiple postoffices can (in fact, will) exist in an Axon system. Each looks
after its own collection of linkages. A linkage created at one postoffice will
*not* be known to other postoffice objects.
