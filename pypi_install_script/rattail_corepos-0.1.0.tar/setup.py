    # Version numbers within comments below have specific meanings.
    # Basically the 'low' value is a "soft low," and 'high' a "soft high."
    # In other words:
    #
    # If either a 'low' or 'high' value exists, the primary point to be
    # made about the value is that it represents the most current (stable)
    # version available for the package (assuming typical public access
    # methods) whenever this project was started and/or documented.
    # Therefore:
    #
    # If a 'low' version is present, you should know that attempts to use
    # versions of the package significantly older than the 'low' version
    # may not yield happy results.  (A "hard" high limit may or may not be
    # indicated by a true version requirement.)
    #
    # Similarly, if a 'high' version is present, and especially if this
    # project has laid dormant for a while, you may need to refactor a bit
    # when attempting to support a more recent version of the package.  (A
    # "hard" low limit should be indicated by a true version requirement
    # when a 'high' version is present.)
    #
    # In any case, developers and other users are encouraged to play
    # outside the lines with regard to these soft limits.  If bugs are
    # encountered then they should be filed as such.
